# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify patients as either **Parkinson’s Disease positive** or **healthy**, based on biomedical voice measurements. The dataset includes several vocal features that are affected by the disease.

## 📌 Project Overview

Parkinson's Disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement and speech. Early detection is critical for effective management. This notebook demonstrates how supervised learning can assist in building predictive models for diagnosis.

## 🧠 ML Pipeline Steps

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model training using multiple classifiers
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/parkinsons-disease-dataset-analysis/data).

## 🤖 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Precision, recall, and F1-score
